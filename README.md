# Hello! 👋, I'm Jonathan!

By ☀, I lead software engineering groups to build some amazing stuff, and by 🌒, I'm continuing to build my skills, primarily in the .NET & Azure space - but I'll still 
tinker with anything!

I really enjoy using small simple life "[problems](https://github.com/MacheteBang/MealBot)" to learn a new technology or design pattern.

* 🌱 I'm currently diving deeper into MVC and Vue.js
* 📫 You can always reach me at [https://jonathangregorsky.com](https://jonathangregorsky.com)!
