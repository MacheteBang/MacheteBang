### Yello! ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jonathan!

By â˜€, I lead software engineering groups to build some amazing stuff, and by ðŸŒ’, I'm continuing to build my skills, primarily in the .NET & Azure space - but I'll still 
tinker with anything!

I really enjoy using small simple life "[problems](https://github.com/MacheteBang/MealBot)" to learn a new technology or design pattern.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on a game for my family called "[More Jeeps!](https://github.com/MacheteBang/More-Jeeps)"
